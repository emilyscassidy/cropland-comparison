# Comparing Commonly-Used Crop Maps of Crop Harvested Area


## Purpose of the Project

Researchers need reliable crop maps to understand how agricultural extent is changing over time. These maps help inform governments about how land use might change with growing food demands. 

This project will provide a reproducible way to compare crop extent maps, with the output being a map of the differences between two maps and a spreadsheet of differences within subnational regions. By creating a reproducible method of comparing different crop maps, this research will improve transparency around agricultural research. 

## Installation instructions 
This code should work if you have the latest version of either Miniconda or Anaconda Python packages installed on your computer.
For instructions for how to set that up, follow the CU Boulder Earth Data Analytics instructions for setting up [Python, Git, Bash Environment On Your Computer](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-git-bash-conda/).


## Data Used

## Workflow

developing an approach to monitor the pace of development and deployment of technologies and practices needed to decarbonize the agriculture sector
Developing resources to compare crop maps from different sources.
